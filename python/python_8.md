# Modles
first: you can find any modle you want here 
[link](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)

second:
 A modle is a Library that makes writing code less time consuming
you can import a modle like this:
```python
import math as m 
# or import math 
# this will import math (e,pi,sin,cos,..) and you can use it in your code as 
pi = m.pi
# you can use the same name of the modle in your code 
# asecond way to import is 
from math import e , pi 
# dir(math) will show you all functions
num = pi
# this will be more specific  
```
## Randum
Another module worth mentioning is the one named random.
It delivers some mechanisms allowing you to operate with pseudorandom numbers.
Note the prefix pseudo - the numbers generated by the modules may look random in the sense that you cannot predict their subsequent values, but don't forget that they all are calculated using very refined algorithms.
```python
from random import random

for i in range(5):
    print(random())
```

## your first module
- name a new file (module), and another one named (main.py) -> then write (import module). Note: both files have to be located in the same folder.
- A new subfolder has appeared Its name is __pycache__.
- write a simple code in the module then check if it works in the main !
- Python can do much more. It also creates a variable called __name__. ( this will print to you the name of the file )
