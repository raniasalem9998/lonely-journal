# lonely-journal
## This journal is about my lonely path in finding where I belong anyway. 
###### 18 OCT, 2020
Since I am now overwhelmed with the paths I was not aware of, and since I discovered that, Man dont I love to simplify things!
I kind of decided to work as anything to finish my masters degree at Physics while I learn something about everything... 
Python, React, UI/UX, Sass, some shortcuts like bootstrap, some other big stuff like AI ... 
It has been a while so this is like the second week, I'll try to note about everything next following days..
