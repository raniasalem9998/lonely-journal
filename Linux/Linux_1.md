# Introduction to Linux 
Linux is everywhere; Linux jobs are everywhere. There is a demand for Linux skills in just about every industry and job category on the planet, and not enough Linux talent to meet this growing demand. It’s also fun and rewarding to work with something that’s so much a part of our modern lives yet which so few people understand.

There are many directions after learning like:
- cybersecurity 
- applications
- games
- apps
- big data
- networking
etc..
#
# Linux is a kernel (operating system)
When most people refer to Linux, they are really referring to a combination of software called GNU/Linux, which defines the operating system. GNU is the free software that provides open source equivalents of many common UNIX commands (written in C language so it's portable).
#
# Linux is Open source
The development of Linux closely parallels the rise of open source software. Open source takes a source-centric view of software. The open source philosophy is that you have a right to obtain the software source code and to modify it for your own use.

Linux adopted this philosophy to great success. Linus made the source programming code (the instructions a computer uses to operate) freely available, allowing others to join in and shape this fledgling operating system.
#
# Linux Has Distributions
People that say their computer runs Linux usually refer to the kernel, tools, and suite of applications that come bundled together in what is referred to as a distribution.

Take Linux and the GNU tools, add some user-facing applications like a web browser and an email client, and you have a full Linux system. Individuals and even companies started bundling all this software into distributions almost as soon as Linux became usable.

***The GNU toolchain is a broad collection of programming tools produced by the GNU Project. These tools form a toolchain (a suite of tools used in a serial manner) used for developing software applications and operating systems.***
#
# Linux Embraces the CLI (command line interface )
Typically operating systems offer both GUI and CLI interfaces. However, most consumer operating systems (Windows, macOS) are designed to shield the user from the complexity of the CLI. The Linux community is different in that it positively celebrates the CLI for its power, speed and ability to accomplish a vast array of tasks with a single command line instruction.Furthermore, by learning the CLI, a user can easily be productive almost instantly on ANY distribution of Linux, reducing the amount of time needed to familiarize themselves with a system because of variations in a GUI.
