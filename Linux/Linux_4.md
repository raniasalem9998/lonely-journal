## Intro
Software projects take the form of source code, which is a human-readable set of computer instructions. Since source code is not understood directly by the computer, it must be compiled into machine instructions by a compiler. The compiler is a special program that gathers all of the source code files and generates instructions that can be run on the computer, such as by the **Linux kernel**.

## Open Source Licensing
When talking about buying software, there are three distinct components:

    - Ownership – Who owns the intellectual property behind the software?
    - Money Transfer – How does money change hands, if at all?
    Licensing– What do you get? What can you   
    - do with the software? Can you use it on only one computer? Can you give it to someone else?
**copyleft** : If you redistribute the software, you must distribute the source to any changes you make.
